## UCB Bootcamp Module 13 Homework Challenge
### Description
This is my submission for the UCB Bootcamp Module 13 Homework Challenge. </br>
This submission:</br>
* Utilizes Express.js API to use Sequilize to interact with a jewelry-themed MySQL inventory database
* Stores the database name and MySQL credentials within an environment variable file
* Connects to the database using Sequelize
* Uses schema and seed commands to create a database and seed with test data
* Uses the CLI to start the server and sync Sequelize models to the MySQL database
* Uses API GET routes to display category, product, and tag information in formatted JSON
* Uses API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create, update, and delete data in the database</br>

This app builds upon starter code provided by edX Boot Camps LLC.

### Installation

### Future Development
